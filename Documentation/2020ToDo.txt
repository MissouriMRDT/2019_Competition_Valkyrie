make the footprints of the op amps have the 2 sides of pins slightly closer together
make sure the diodes are seperating the cell voltages bc when testing
	many many volts go to tiva pins
order it with twice as thick copper layers
more via stitching on the power planes
keep copper out of keep out zone of mounting holes(make mounting holes first)
AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT PUT BUZZER UNDER TIVA BC WE CANT HEAR IT.
