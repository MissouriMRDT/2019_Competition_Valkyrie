Notes for Fixing PowerBoard

File Structure
Get rid of the eagle and Evan Hite folder. Just keep the stuff you have
Download the Roveso drive 2019 elec arch resources and download .gitignore and place it in top level
Rename to PowerBoard_Hardware for everything and the folder that contains it
Put Documentation Files into a new folder. Labe this folder Documentation. (Pin map, connections, all that sort of thing)


Schematic
-Get rid of Power Input
-Under Power Conditioning Capacitance - change to TVS symbol 1.5KExxA
-Add note about 30.8 Volts on those diodes in the aformentioned note
-Under Value (Place the 1.5KE36)
-Add in some extra fields for Working Voltage and the other voltages
-Mirror the Tivas so that they go from 1-10 instead of 10-1
-Naming Convention for M1-SIG to M1_CTL, M1_IMEAS so on and so forth
-Flags need to have a little connection line 
-Have your tiva pins in and even manor, X9 be with X9 and such
-Decoupling Capacitors, make bring the connection wires to be the same
-Check the control pins on the DC-DC Converters, make sure they are the right configuration of pins.e change the name to this
-On Capacitor C7 change the ground orientation
-Change the ATC_FUSE_Block to just a normal fuse, it should work
-Check the FETS on LOGIC 12V also change its name so its accurate. 
Change the current sensor to the 722 40AU one
-Change all 3.3V flags to power flags
-Adjust the capacitors so that it flows from top to bottom, not left to right
-Jump up the Resistors on the LED's to be 500 Ohm instead of 1K
-Change the 5k ohms on the motor busses to 1.5K
-Center Motors 1-7 and Aux
-Go to File and Page Settings to add in all the stuff. Make it fancy!


Layout
Adjust the Angles on the bends for the signal wires
Jack up the 3.3V line to 40 or 30 Mil if you don't have room
Make the text on M1 much larger
.2,.2,.025 are the thickness and size
Check your silkscreen, Put names of the Buses next to the LED's
Adjust corners so that they fit specifications of the drill holes
Include a large 3.3V Bus on both sides(Possibly a polygon maybe, just an idea
Include a + and - sign at the input terminals for VBatt
Imeas COM offshoot, delete it.
No backtracking on the signals, its under the tiva, just go ahead and fix that
3.3V oki to show we know what it is
Label the current for each fuse 20 for actuation, 5 for logic and communication and 30 Amp for motor busses
Missouri University of Science and Technology
Actuation Bus Polygun, make it bigger
Unconnect the 5V 
Unconnect the Reset
At the oki, put a ground via at each node
Move the control Nfets up so that they are no onger eating into the PVDD plane
Move the top busses to the right a little bit, about 50-70 mils. Give it a decent amount
Move Oki's down , middle of the oki is a post hole
Create a hole with a diameter of .145 inches. And a keepout zone of 1.9 times the hole diameter


Write up all the parts that you have made and generate a BOM
