Power Conversion
	The OKI comes in 2 versions, one that ouptus 3.3V and one that outputs 5V. We want the one that outputs 3.3V because we don't use 5V anywhere else on the schematic and the TIVA reuires a 3.3V logic signal and power
Power LED
	You can put that anywhere on the schematic. The power LED doesn't need a button, since that will turn on when the board is on. Just run a 3.3V power flag through a 500 Ohm resstor and LED in series. 
Anderson Ciruit
	The anderson circuit is connected through the 3.3V power flag (see above). Swap the 5V flag for 3.3V
Pot_Ind
	Basically, place a label coming out of one of the pins of the TIVA, and then place another label in the schematic that goes through a 500 ohm resistor and LED to ground. The Pot_Ind flag should be connected to a pin that has "Analog Write" funcionality as per the "Energia TM4C129 Launchpad Pinout"

--Other Schematic Notes---
	the "Pot_Out flag needs to be connected to an "Analog Read" pin on the TIVA-https://energia.nu/pinmaps/img/EK-TM4C1294XL-FRONT.jpg

I think it would be nice to add an LED to indicate whether or not we're connected to a system. Ie, when we plug into the arm board, an LED would turn on indicating that we are connected to the arm board
	These would be software-LEDs, similar to the one we're runing for Pot_Ind but it doesn't have to be connected to an "Analog Write" pin. 
	I would add 4 LEDs, one for each system

The schematic looks very clean and nice. I think were only a review or two away from going to the layout.

//////////////////////////////////
Potentiometer Input needs analogRead
Potentiometer Indicator Output needs analogWrite
	On the link, analogRead  pins are shown in blue
		     analogWrite pins are shown in purple
The red outer values are for the SPI bus, basically its a way of transfering bytes of data serially. the acronums stand for
	CLK(X):Clock output
	CS (X):Chip select (Raise high when the transfer is complete
	MOSI(X): Master Output Slave Input (Transmission signal)
	MISO(X): Master Input Slave Output (Recieve signal)

The pins you used for pot_In and Pot_Out work. Pot_Out is onnected to PD4 which is analog read pin A7
					       Pot_Ind is conncted to PA5 which is purple on the diagram

My bad for not explaining the reserved pins
The Following pins are reserved: 
	+5V, +3V3, GND are reserved to power the TIVA
	Rese-Basically if this pin goes high the launchpad resets. Leave the pin unconnected if not used
	You can route to any other pin based on the functionality of the chart in the link I sent you. Next to the power and reset pins there is no green o purple label to indicate digital read/write functionality
	I can go more in depth on how to read the chart next call, and what each of the pins do.

For the power pins, we need to supply the TIVA with either 3.3V (through the +3V3 pin) or 5V (Trhough the +5V pin) as well as ground, so go ahead and add the +3V3 flags and GND flags to their respective pins
I think I forgot to mention this, my bad. Let's make the indicator LEDs for the sections blue. POT ind can stay yellow and power can stay green

Yes, you can remove the LED on the potnetiometer. Because the resistance between pins 1 and 3 dos not change, the LED wouldn't change when the POT value changes.
