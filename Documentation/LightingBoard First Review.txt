power flags for 5v and GND

power cicuitry in upper left

leave one dot for connections( one dot before  GND)

get rid of Vact with Vlag- set a side by side footprint
get rid of switch
label PV to Headlight_Vin
in future might use Vact and get rid of PV
futher testing 

note double check neo pixel pinout

fix PV pad 
change PV anderson to CONN2

Ideally power out the side and signal out the top- makes sense

50mill power traces for headlights
everything else is 15mill

No via on power traces

12V log to ap1509 30 mill trace size

stacked vertically LED(mostly likely 3) label each horizontally (power_in[green], Headlights[orange], Neopixel[yellow]

label SL

fix LDD package by flipping it?

name LightingBoard_Hardware

connect C1 to 5V to GND

CHange R1 to 470 ohm

Match LDD drive diemensions schematic
remake symbol and package
from old symbol flip the LDD change everything to Fsilk and rotate one

redownload kicad libraries

power upper left tiva to right of that 
headlight drivers below power and right of that connectors

add box for indicators in the schematic
500 ohm resistor- LED- GND in order
flip
