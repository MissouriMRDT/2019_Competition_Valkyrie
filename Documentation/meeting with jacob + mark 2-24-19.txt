-Make boards shorter
-1 board with andersons pointed in (soldering)

-New diodes
-vertical conectors, moved below headers (sanfan's board)
-andersons can go closer to edge (sanfan's board)
-remove power out andersons (sanfan's board)
-clean up layouts and traces
-another LED from motor to ground

Drive Board notes
-reduce height to 75mm
-all andersons will be vertical
	-label the andersons with GND, LOG, AUX
-Eliminate the 5V power out anderson (2 side by side)
-all molex sl will be vertical
-Keep circuitry for solinoid, lazers, and servos the same
	-New location is center of board between andersons and the max3232
-Add two more serial busses in the schematic
	-this means another max3232
	-change 3pin molex sl to 5pin sl
		-order of pins(left to right): tx1, rx1, gnd, tx2, rx2
