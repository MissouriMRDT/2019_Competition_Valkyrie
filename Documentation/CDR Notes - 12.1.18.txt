-Make a new folder called CameraBoard_Hardware
	Put all hardware files in that folder and change CameraBoard to CameraBoard_Hardware
-Another folder called Libraries
	Basically what new parts is now, devices and packages
-DONE Use the MRDT 1509 (called 1059) instead of the one I used
-DONE Use the same schematic from sensor pod from last year (sensorpod_hardware)
-DONE Use +12V flag and +3V3 flag instead of the labels
-DONE Clean up the schematic around the schottky diodes
-DONE Output +5V from the AP1509 and give +5V to the muxs instead of +3.3V. Still uses same circuit and same package
-DONE Set the pin for SHDN as inverted and remove the asterisk from the name
-DONE Jumper to select 5V or resistor divider to 10V for power input to MAX4314
	-Choose resistors in range of 100 - 1000 for the divider so as to give enough current
	-See picture of resistor divider
-DONE Make the SHDN flags output
-DONE Add SW_ERR label for LED and to any digital pin on the header
-DONE To fix +12V net issue on Conn1, make andersons both 1X
-DONE Use diode 0603 hand soldering for schottky diode

Layout Notes
-Add labels for LEDs to layout
-Change trace width across the board to 15 mil
	-you can change many widths at once by using filter selection on the whole board and changing it there
-DONE Change the ap1509 footprint to the one used in MRDT libraries, soic-8-3.9x4.9mm
-Clean up the traces by undoing the vertical horizontal behavior where it's not needed
-Right click zone outline and edit the default pad connection to solid
-Check that all grounds are connected after the fill zones are filled
-Check trace kinks and remove them
-DONE Change CAM_INPUT text to CAM IN
-Silkscreen text on the cam outputs (CAM OUT)
-Replace tiva with throughhole variant to avoid having to drop down to the second layer so often
-Missouri S&T on label
-Use the add footprint tool to add the logo and signature silkscreens
