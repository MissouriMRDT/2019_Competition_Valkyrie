LiDAR capacitor is backwards on layout //
	also make it a polar cap in shcematic//
we're sending 5V to the LiDAR I2C pins through the pullup resistors. those should go to 3.3V //


LiDAR might need an ATmega in the board to communicate correctly. Our ATmegas are ATmega328P-PU (longer thin form factor).

--Schematic
Remove IMU I2C connections and replace with Serial Connection//
The External Connector" with IC_Rx/Tx is for programming. Name them Prgogramming Tx/Rx, also add a ground connection to the SL4 //

Add an SL with serial and ground for the IMU//
Power the LiDAR off 5V instead of 3.3V (Because we're working with an ATMEGA) for bith power rails//
Remove IMU SCL/SDA inidcators, and replace with IMU Serial Indicators//
Rename TIVATx/Rx to GPS Rx/Tx (Because now we have two serials)//
	Then name the other (ATMEGA TxRx)//
Reset resistor should be 1k //
Add a capacitor o ATMEGA VCC //
