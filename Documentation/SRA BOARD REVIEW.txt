SRA BOARD REVIEW
File Managment
	X SRASensorBoard_Hardware
	X move documetaion folder to root
	X add library folder for all libraries
Schematic
	X wireing for AP1509
	X Rename inductor from h to l
	X 500 ohm resistors for leds
	X Change the LED to D1
	X led to 3.3V, 5V,
	X Led for soil data, mq4 data, atm out, toggle
	X software defined led
		X 1 for error
		X 2 for other software flags
	X move labels by sensors
	push sensor software to new branch
	X upload sht10 documentation, am2302 documentation
	X analog in should be analog out , fix that flag
	X toggle to uv toggle, signal goes through 500 ohm resistor
	X PIN D2_3 should be output flag
	X GND flags pointing down
	X text next to leds indicating color
	re-route ccd pinout to the correct location
	X re-route sdata, cs, sclk, to sl04 with ground flag
	X sdata, sclk, cs output flags
	X MOVE Sdata, sclk, cs, PF_1, PF_3, PF_2 respectivly. 
	X soil_sck to PB_5
PCB Board layout
	set polygons to soild
	set traces to be in the middle of the pin holes when tracing
	more paths to ground 
	change bit for to have a via and put the majority of that trace on back copper
	rework the traces to be more up and down, and left and right not diagnolay
	make my traces not snake through the Pin heads
	make bit3 go underneath the top connectors
	make traces nice and tight
	reconfigure anderson and molex five, switch there spots
	next board align to grid
	possible 20 mil traces for master_clock
	don't run power traces above or below master_clock
	have all sensors next to each other on top 
	put sensor resistors on the bottom of the board
	silk screens around each connector to tell us where the pins go
	
	soil T/M, NEW LINE PART NUMBER
