Move Zener Diode to the VNH circuitry and replace labels  --DONE


When building board don't populate the current sensing circuitry and put 0ohm on CS_Dis

Next year look into a reverse polarity circuit

Maybe put in electrolitic if theres room   --- DONE
If there's space in layout add an LED for Tx_2 as well  -- DONE
Add led in series with LS so we can see if the limit switch is closed or not -- DONE
Add atleast 2 electrolitic capacitors to the 12v Value: 47u, diameter: 5mm, lead spacing: anything just make sure you get the proper package on kicad
	--DONE
Change the silkscreen on slide switch to be CW or CCW --DONE
	
Change naming on Out_A1_M1 etc to be more consistent  -- DONE

Layout:
Spread out the capacitors on the 12vAct --DONEISH
Move the diodes on the motors off to the sides of their corresponding currents so its easier to tell the direction 
	Make sure the resistors have enough space for the GND  --DONE?
Rotate oki to better connect the 12vLog and move capactors with it  --DONE
Make the 3.3v trace consistent at that one weird part. --DONE
Make sure the LS leds are consistent with the encoders  --DONE
Move C10 over a little and the vias with it so its not as close to the pad  --DONE
Move the 12vLog trace to the bottom layer to relieve more gnd space --DONE
Label the connectors of the LS and ENC ( + - Sig
Make the LS #ing (top left is #1) --DONE

(Schm and Layout) 
Delete the Rx_Tiva and just copy what was done with the SL connections over the the 2_SL  --DONE


MAKE SURE BOM AND PIN LAYOUT ARE UPDATED AND CURRENT  --DONE
