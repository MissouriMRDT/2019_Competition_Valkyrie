**Make Bus indicate it's for the WatchDog_IND**  **Done**
**Lspeed_IND, Rspeed_IND** route to purple analog pins   **Done**
Flush polygon outline with board    **Done**
Set Default Pad Connection on polygons to solid 
Retrace Tiva header isolating ground around and through Anderson PP
Retrace Tiva header traces through upper Tiva header straight to Molex 
Symmetry and condensity when routing; 10 mils apart between traces 
Eliminate vias on capactior components connected to 3232's 
Try to line up components directly with each other and their respective pins (if possible)
Use snap to pad to line up components better 
Move Moter labels inside molex sl-05 connectors and get rid of invisible text 
Copy bottom-right curved edge and use it to replace other three board edges 
Move and line up molex LED indicators straight under molex connectors 
Add text to indicate (Tx) on molex LED indicators 
Move molex connectors down and flush yellow line with connectors 
Start with required components and place connectors last 
Move traces closer together 
12V supply from Anderson should be 30 mils 
Optimize AP1509 so capacitors/components are closer to IC and layout is as efficient as possible
Trace 12V 30 mil trace up through Anderson and along edge of board and through middle of AP1509 and directly connect to 12V pin 
Make LED in-line with each other 
LED indicators on Tivas: 
	-Power label ~ Green
	-Watchdog ~ Red 
	-Rspeed ~ Yellow 
	-Lspeed ~ Yellow 
		~put a box around labels 
Add vias into bottom GND plane for isolated grounded sections 
Run unconnected to detect isolated grounded sections
