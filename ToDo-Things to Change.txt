Rename board from "round_2" to "IMUBreakout_Hardware"
	This means changig the name of every file n the project to that
	Also, move the project file under the "Break out board" folder and rename that folder as well
	
Add jumpers in order to MUX IMU I2C address (I think that goes to SDOAG and SDOM)
Net labels would be nice
Label the connector on the board so we know what signals are going outMake LSM90S1 visible on silkscreen
Copper fills on board

Make an actual Edge.Cuts board outline, not just silkscreen
	Confer with GSS team to determine how the boardis to be mounted. I would recommend using the "4-40 Hole Corner" found in "MRDT-Drill Holes"
	Figure out an arragnement that will make the best use of space
Place the SL so it goes just over the edge of the board

Add a text file outlining the pinout for the SL-8 and each pins function 

Add rover logo and board header
The trace on pin 2 is kinked
