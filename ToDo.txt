--ToDo--
Move design files into a sub-folder in the repo called "CameraBoard"
DONE Rename all files from "2019-CameraBoard" to "CameraBoard"

--Schematic
Camera Connectors
	DONE Rename "Molex_Sl_03" to "Camera_X"
BNC Connector
	Use "Conn_Coaxial" under "Connector" library
	(Same as board in deprecated systems, wasn't able to figure out why) I belive the 75Ohm for CAM_OUT should be in parallel with ground. I could be wrong about that. Show me some documentation to explain why you have it wired that way
	Also, it would be nice to have some documentation on why we do the 75 OHM pull-down. I have an intuitive understanding but could you do that rsearch?

DONE Use boarders to seperate out sections. 
MAX4314ESD Symbol
	DONE You can make it a bit thinner. There's no reason for all the white space
	DONE Fill the background of the symbol with the cream color
	I feel like you culd break from exactly matching the pin layout in the symbol. Group the pins together by fucntion. Inputs on the left. outputs on the Right
	You should be able to select SHDN as "Inverting Input" type
DONE I would put the TIVA connectors on the left and the Camera on the right. Power in the tp-left

Make sure your Ground flavs are pointing down (Pull them out if you need to) and your power flags are pointing up
I'd use the +3V3 and +12V pwoer flag instead of "VCC" and the 12V label
Power Filtering
	Instead of using a bank of capacitors there, put one 10uF at the VCC of each MUX, and 1 on the output of the AP1509
	use 1 1uF on the 12V input of the AP1509 and 1 10u on the 12V in for each connector. 
TIVA Connction
	PF1, PF3 and PF2, PG0 are the same label. I thing you forgot to re-name them
Buck converter
	You need a 12V to 3.3V buck converter. Use this IC:https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/diodes-incorporated/AP1509-33SG-13/AP1509-33SGDICT-ND/1301652
	There's a schematic in the datasheet. 

LED
	Use 500 OHM for all resistors (including power filtering)
	add LED to MUXA1, A0, B1, B0
	Add LED for SOftware Error flag from any DIO pin
MUXA/B_SHDN no routed to anything. Pull them high or put them on a pin with a set of LEDs
